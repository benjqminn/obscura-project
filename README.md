## Obscura Usage

To get started with Obscura, you need to have access to the private repository. For security reasons, the source code is not publicly available. However, this `README.md` is public to showcase legitimacy and technical depth.

If you're a recruiter coming from LinkedIn and would like to verify the implementation, feel free to DM me on LinkedIn. I‚Äôll provide you with a `fine-grained personal access token` to review the source securely.





## Prerequisites

Make sure your local system is equipped with:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code + Dev Containers Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

You‚Äôll also need basic familiarity with:

- Terminal / command line
- React / Flask basics





## Workflow Overview

This is the development workflow I follow when building out Obscura.

### 1. PCAP Collection & Parsing
- Gather `.pcap` files from simulated or real traffic.
- Parse with `pyshark` in a Python backend script.
- Extract and normalize packet metadata.

### 2. Threat Detection
- Run parsed data against custom rules:
  - ‚úÖ YARA rule matches
  - ‚úÖ SYN scan behavior
  - ‚úÖ Brute force login heuristics
- Log alerts into `logs/alerts.log` in real time.

### 3. React Frontend & Live Feed
- TailwindCSS + React + Chart.js frontend
- Fetches live alerts via `/alerts` endpoint
- Displays logs in a scrollable feed
- Charts update on interval to show attack frequency

### 4. Upload & Analysis
- User can upload `.pcap` files
- Flask backend re-parses and applies detection
- Frontend instantly reflects new alerts

### 5. Deployment
- Dockerized backend + frontend
- Ready for Render deployment
- Public-facing dashboard w/ recruiter-facing token control





## Dev Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
# (Requires GitHub access token)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/obscura.git
cd obscura

# Set up virtualenv and install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd obscura-dashboard
npm install

# Start Flask backend
cd ../obscura
python server.py

# Start React frontend
cd ../obscura-dashboard
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the dashboard.
